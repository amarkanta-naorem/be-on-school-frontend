# BeOnSchool Frontend Development

**BeOnSchool** is a Learning Management System (LMS) where instructors can create courses and the students can enroll.

This repo. contains the frontend part of the **BeOnSchool** app, built using **React.js**.


## What is BeOnSchool?

BeOnSchool helps instructors and students connect and learn online.
Instructors can create courses and the students can enrolled, attend live classes and track thier learning progress

### Some features I've plan to include:
 - **Learning Paths**: to guide students through courses.
 - **Tracking class attendance**: for student during live sessions.
 - **More features coming soon...**


## Why the name BeOnSchool?
 
The name **BeOnSchool** means **"being in school"** even when you are online. It gives a feeling that students and teachers are always connected and focused on learning, just like in a real school.
